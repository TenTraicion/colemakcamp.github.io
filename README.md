# Colemak Camp
A fork of Colemak Club that overhauls the entire experience. Brings support for custom themes and a wider range of display sizes.

It is hosted on this repo's [Github Pages](https://colemakcamp.github.io/).

## Forked from Colemak Club
This project is a fork of [Colemak Club](https://github.com/gnusenpai/colemakclub), which itself is a fork of [Colemak Academy](https://colemak.academy/). The source project is AGPL-3.0, as discussed in this [issue](https://github.com/Nemcorp/layoutacademy/issues/2). This project also retains that license.

## License
As mentioned already, this project is under the **[GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)**, but that only applies to the original Colemak Academy and this fork. Colemak Club does not mention a license (at the time of writing this), but it should also be the same. I phrase it like that because this project uses some elements that don't fall under this license. Those are mentioned separately in this table:
